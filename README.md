### Linux Programming &amp; Stuff

[LP&amp;S](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7JijJhmmKrXaGyAxSJNBsQ) is a YouTube channel devoted to Linux Programming
and Stuff. The content is unscripted and unedited videos of me trying to program. While I do try to explain what I'm
doing I'm often doing that thing for the first time and so the videos are not intended to be educational. It's just
real programming warts and all.

I'm currently re-learning "C" which I haven't used for 25 or more years. The primary long term focus of the channel
is [Space Captain](https://github.com/mgreenly/space-captain). This repo and the channel are the meta-layer of the 
games development.
