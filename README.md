[Linux Programming and Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7JijJhmmKrXaGyAxSJNBsQ) is a YouTube channel where the content is devoted to unscripted, unedited videos of linux programming. While I do try and share my thought process it's not explicitly intended to be educational content. Rather it's just me trying to work through problems, usually for the first time, so I'm learning right along with you.

I'm currently working on a game I'm calling [Space Captain](https://github.com/mgreenly/space-captain). I'm also re-learning "C" which I haven't used for 25 or more years and I'm starting to spend more time experimenting with various LLMs for code generation and research.
