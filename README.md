### Welcome

[Linux Programming and Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7JijJhmmKrXaGyAxSJNBsQ) is a YouTube channel where the
content is devoted to unscripted, unedited videos of linux programmign and stuff. While I do try and share my thought
process it's not intended to be educational content. Rather it's just me trying to work through problems, usually for
the first time, so I'm learning right along with you.

I'm currently re-learning "C" which I haven't used for 25 or more years and working on a game I'm currently calling
[Space Captain](https://github.com/mgreenly/space-captain). This repo and the youtube channel are the meta-layer of
the games development. Any code or artifacts I create during videos that don't belong in the games repo will end up
here.
