### Welcome

[Linux Programming and Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7JijJhmmKrXaGyAxSJNBsQ) is a YouTube channel where the content is devoted to unscripted, unedited videos of linux programming. While I do try and share my thought process while working, the content is not explicitly intended to be educational, rather it's just me trying to work through what ever problem is at hand, usually doing that thing for the first time ever, meaning I'm learning right along with the viewer.

If you're new and want to catch up the best way is to use the [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@LinuxProgrammingandStuff/playlists).

I'm currently working on a game I'm calling [Space Captain](https://github.com/mgreenly/space-captain). I'm currently in a phase where I'm doing lots of experimentation and trying to decide how I'll structure it. So, it seems like I'm not working it but I am.

I'm also re-learning "C" which I haven't used for 25 or more years.

I'm also starting to spend more time experimenting with various LLMs for code generation and research.

It's the early days and things will evolve.
